## Introduction
Customer segmentation is a crucial strategy for businesses to understand their customer base better and provide personalized experiences. This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes various customer attributes, such as:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income of the customer
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/k-means-clustering.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd k-means-clustering
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To use the model, follow these steps:

1. Load the dataset:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv('Mall_Customers.csv')
    ```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to perform clustering:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook K-MEANS.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, apply the K-Means algorithm, and visualize the clusters.

## Modeling
The project involves the following steps to build and evaluate the clustering model:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Elbow Method**: Using the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
3. **K-Means Clustering**: Applying the K-Means algorithm to segment customers.
4. **Visualization**: Visualizing the clusters using various plots to understand the segmentation better.

## Results
The results of the clustering are visualized using different plots, such as scatter plots, to show the distinct customer segments. Detailed visualizations and interpretations are provided in the Jupyter Notebook.
